	<h2 id="doesiwriterhaveanurlscheme">Does iWriter have a URL scheme?</h2>
	<p>For now, x-callback-url schemes are not supported.</p>
	
	<h2 id="howcanisavemydocumenticantfindasavebutton.">How can I save my document? I can’t find a save button.</h2>
	<p>iWriter implements autosave. You should not care about document saving. All changes are saved automatically.</p>

	<h2 id="isautomaticthemeswitchingsupported">Is automatic theme switching supported?</h2>
	
	<p>Yes. Automatic theme switching works in tandem with the system’s appearance settings. iWriter “memorizes” chosen themes for both system appearance modes (Light and Dark). For manual appearance selection please navigate to <code>Settings &gt; Display &amp; Brightness</code>.</p>

	<h2 id="canirestoreapreviousversionofadocument">Can I restore a previous version of a document?</h2>

	<p>You can do that for iCloud documents. To browse document’s versions:</p>

	<ol>
	<li>Navigate to <code>iCloud &gt; iWriter</code>.</li>
	<li>Press <code>Select</code> and choose the document.</li>
	<li>Press the <code>Versions</code> button located in the top navigation bar.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2 id="howtodiscoverkeyboardshortcutsonipad">How to discover keyboard shortcuts on iPad?</h2>
	
	<ol>
	<li>Attach the external keyboard to iPad.</li>
	<li>Tap the editor’s field.</li>
	<li>Press and hold the command button (⌘).</li>
	</ol>

	<h2 id="igetanerrormessagewhentryingtorenameadocument.">I get an error message when trying to rename a document.</h2>
	<p>Files located outside the iWriter Pro’s own folders are impossible to rename from within the editor. This issue happens due to iOS security restrictions. 
		They cannot be lifted via Privacy settings. iWriter Pro has full access to its own folders (local and iCloud). Those folders can be located by application icon.</p>
	<p>You can rename files in other locations from within the Document Menu. Tap and hold on a file, then choose <code>Rename</code>.</p>

	<h2 id="doesiwritersupportrtf">Does iWriter support RTF?</h2>
	<p>iWriter doesn’t have RTF support. You can use iWriter Pro for Mac to export your documents as RTF.</p>
	
	<h2 id="isthereamacversion">Is there a Mac version?</h2>
	<p>iWriter doesn’t have a Mac version. iWriter Pro has both iOS and Mac versions.</p>

	<h2 id="privacypolicy">Where can I find privacy policy for iWriter?</h2>
	<p>You can read it <a href="./iwriter_policy.html">here</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="ihaveanotherquestion…">I have another question…</h2>
	<p>If you have a question that is not covered here, <script type="text/javascript">contact_us("contact us", "iWriter - Feedback")</script> and we’ll answer as best as we can. We take a break on the weekends, but during weekdays we aim to reply within 1–2 business days. Please note that the more detailed your description is, the quicker and better we can answer. The device model, correct app name, OS version, or screenshots will also help a lot.</p>

	<h2 id="ihaveafeaturerequest…">I have a feature request…</h2>
	<p>You can send your request via e-mail <script type="text/javascript">contact_us("here", "iWriter - Feature Request")</script>. Please note that not all features can be added to the final product. Leaving a one star comment on the App Store while asking for a feature has never helped anyone.</p>
